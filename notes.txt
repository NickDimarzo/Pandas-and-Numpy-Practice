notes from the video
- Numpy is the core library for scientific and numerical computing in python
- high performance multidimensional array object and tools for working with arrays
- numpys's main object is the multidimensional array
- it is a table of elements (usually numbers) all of the same type. indexed by a tuple of positive intergers 
- in numpy dimensions are called axes


- one dimension array:
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 - one element
Shape: (6,)

- two dimension array:
0 1 2 3 - two elements
4 5 6 7
Shape:(2,4)

why use Numpy arrray vs python list
- fast
- convienient 
- less memory
